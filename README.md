In this study we will be focused on:

 * loading a large dataset
 * creating various feature objects and injecting them into different models
 * evaluating the predictions of those models
 * utilizing tools like Deep feature synthesis and feature transformations
 * understanding metrics like feature importances, for looking at a model post-training
 
 To help us to conclude such task, we will use the package [Feature Tools](https://www.featuretools.com)
